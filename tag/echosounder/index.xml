&lt;a href="https://echopype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/why.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enhancing the interoperability and scalability&lt;/a>
in processing ocean sonar data for biological information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I started building this package in early 2018 when I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find an affordable tool that
allow easy access and manipulation of echosounder data collected by
different sonar models.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="description">Description&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We are looking for a highly motivated and independent individual to join the
&lt;a href="https://uw-echospace.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Echospace&lt;/a> group at the University of Washington (UW) as a research software engineer. This will be a 12-month project appointment, with potential continuation based on funding availability and demonstration of skill developments throughout the appointment period.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The research software engineer’s primary responsibility is to develop computational and data workflows to enable efficient, open, cloud-native processing and exploration of ocean sonar data and the associated biological and environmental data.&lt;/strong> The engineer will support ongoing research projects in the group that focus on extracting biological information from the ever-growing Big Acoustic Data. This work will encompass several interconnected elements: optimizing computational operations for distributed computing, building a scalable cloud cyberinfrastructure, developing open-source software to perform specific data processing and analysis tasks, and providing tools to generate and interact with data that comply with a prescribed set of interoperable community standards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The projects are in close collaboration with the NOAA Fisheries Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) with a primary goal of developing a high-throughput echosounder data analysis pipeline to contribute to fishery stock assessment and ecosystem-based management. We are sponsored by the NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration and Research and NOAA Fisheries, and the engineer will have the opportunity to interact with the vibrant ocean sciences and data science communities at UW and in Seattle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The UW
&lt;a href="https://uw-echospace.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Echospace&lt;/a> group, based jointly at the
&lt;a href="https://www.apl.washington.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Applied Physics Laboratory&lt;/a> (APL) and
&lt;a href="https://escience.washington.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eScience Institute&lt;/a>, is a highly collaborative research group with members with diverse backgrounds and experiences. Our research centers around acoustic ocean sensing and data science, and spans a broad spectrum from development of computational methods, open source software, cloud applications, to joint analysis of acoustic observations and ocean environmental variables. We are committed to provide a supportive environment for group members to grow and contribute to the acoustics, oceanography, and data science communities.&lt;/p>
