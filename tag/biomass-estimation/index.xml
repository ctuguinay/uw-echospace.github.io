&lt;a href="https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/index-eng.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) - Pacific Region&lt;/a> to estimate total biomass of
&lt;a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/pacific-whiting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pacific hake&lt;/a> by incorporating acoustic and biological trawl data from the
&lt;a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/west-coast/science-data/joint-us-canada-integrated-ecosystem-and-pacific-hake-acoustic-trawl-survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joint U.S.-Canada Integrated Ecosystem and Pacific Hake Acoustic-Trawl Survey&lt;/a> (aka the &amp;ldquo;Hake survey&amp;rdquo;).
These biomass estimates are the inputs for the stock assessment of hake and need to be completed in an efficient and timely manner after the survey. The biomass estimates are currently produced by a suite of Matlab scripts operated by a single user, and the analysis procedures are not easily adaptable by other FEAT/DFO team members. The central objective of this project is to provide a well-documented open-source Python software package that contains the core computational functionality of the current Matlab EchoPro program and provides basic visualization of the analysis results. The new software package will contain an Application Programming Interface (API) that can be invoked in a reproducible manner and can accept configuration of key analysis parameters and other run-time setups via a machine and human-readable configuration file.&lt;/p>

To take advantage of the recent technological advances in collecting acoustic data via platforms different from the traditional ship-based systems, such as uncrewed marine systems (UxSs), we need to seek alternative strategies that can provide crucial biological information. Through the Hake biological data integration project (HakeIGP), the echospace team is assisting the

&lt;a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/northwest-fisheries-science-center" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC)&lt;/a> as they explore the applicability of using biological information for
&lt;a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/pacific-whiting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pacific hake&lt;/a> from bottom trawl (BT) surveys and the at-sea hake observer programs (OP) in both U.S. and Canadian waters to augment coast-wide hake acoustic surveys using UxSs. This work will involve the integration of the AT, BT, and OP biological data from 2003 to 2019 into a NWFSC-hosted database with a unified format. This will enable the quantitative evaluation of similarities and differences among the three data sources and assessment of the associated variability. The resulting software and workflow will facilitate the integration of all three data sources into a unified format and enable research to answer two important questions: (1) Can we use biological data from alternative sources to provide effective and satisfactory biomass estimates or biomass indices for UxSs-based acoustic surveys? (2) Can we extract new biological information on hake by analyzing the integrated fishery–dependent (OP) and fishery–independent (AT and BT) data?&lt;/p>
